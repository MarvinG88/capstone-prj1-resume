    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I mostly enjoy doing things that involved solving problems. Some of those things are:
        <ol>
            <li>Building different kinds of websites using different kinds of technologies to understand how each technology works.</li>
            <li>Installing and runnung development environments using different server tools and operating systems to see how they work together.</li>
            <li>Reading up on how technology can be used to solve a problem and recreating the solutions.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than these activities you can catch me doing random tasks on my computer, hanging with my partner and dog, cooking a Korean or Indian dish or meditating.
